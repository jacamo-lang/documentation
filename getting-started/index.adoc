This guide walks you through the process of creating a Multi-Agent application using JaCaMo platform.


= What You Will Build

You will build a very simple Multi-Agent System composed of two agents that exchange simple messages. These agents are named Bob and Alice. In the application, Alice sends a hello message to Bob.

NOTE: As a getting  started, the environment and organisation dimensions of JaCaMo will not be explored here. 

= What You Need

* Java 17 or newer
* A shell terminal
* A text editor

= Creating an initial application

ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

The following commands will create a new JaCaMo application with some initial code for agents,  environment and organisation. 
NOTE: The first time you run takes longer since it downloads JaCaMo.


Unix::
+
----------------
curl -LO http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np1.1.zip
unzip np1.1.zip
./gradlew --console=plain
----------------

Windows::
1. Download http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np1.1.zip
2. Unzip
3. Run `gradlew.bat`

//https://curl.haxx.se[`curl`] is a program that simply downloads the `np07.zip` file from http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np07.zip.

You will be asked to give an identification to the application, here we will use `my1st-app`.


Example of output:
----
> Task :run
JaCaMo 1.1 built on Wed Apr 06 19:16:53 BRT 2022

Enter the identification of the new application: my1st-app

You can run your application with:
   cd my1st-app
   ./gradlew -q --console=plain
----

Several files were created, the most relevant are:

----
├── build.gradle       // Gradle script to run the application
├── logging.properties // Logging configuration
├── my1st_app.jcm      // Application main file
└── src
    ├── agt            // Code for agents
    │   └── sample_agent.asl
    ├── env            // Code for environment
    │   └── tools
    │       └── Counter.java
    └── org            // Code for organisation
        └── org.xml

= Execution

The application is ready to be executed with the command:
