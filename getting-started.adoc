= JaCaMo Installation
:toc: right

ifdef::env-github[:outfilesuffix: .adoc]

We have different options to start using JaCaMo: simple shell script commands, Gradle, eclipse or Docker.

Eclipse and shell script options require that you download and install JaCaMo in your machine.
Since the shell script, Gradle, and Docker options do not include an IDE, you can either import the project into an Eclipse workspace (instructions are shown by the creation script) or use some text editor (we suggest Atom, see below).

== Gradle

Requirements:

- Java >= 17

Follow the steps below to create a new application:

NOTE: The first time you run takes longer since it downloads JaCaMo.

Unix::
+
----------------
curl -LO http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np1.1.zip
unzip np1.1.zip
./gradlew --console=plain
----------------

Windows::
1. Download http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np1.1.zip
2. Unzip
3. Run `gradlew.bat`

TIP: Instead of `np1.1.zip` you can use `npss.zip` to create a JaCaMo application based on the current snapshot version.

//https://curl.haxx.se[`curl`] is a program that simply downloads the `np07.zip` file from http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/nps/np07.zip.

You will be asked to enter the identification of the application and then instructions about how to run it will be shown.

Example of output:
----
> Task :run
JaCaMo 1.1 built on Wed Apr 06 19:16:53 BRT 2022

Enter the identification of the new application: helloworld
Creating path /Users/jomi/tmp/helloworld

You can run your application with:
   cd /Users/jomi/tmp/helloworld
   ./gradlew -q --console=plain

or (if you have JaCaMo scripts installed)
   jacamo helloworld.jcm
----

If you want to run a JaCaMo application that was not created with a `build.gradle` file, you can download a template from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo/master/src/main/resources/templates/build.gradle[here] and replace

- `<VERSION>` by the required JaCaMo release (e.g. `1.0`)
- `<PROJECT-FILE>` by your .jcm file (e.g. `hello.jcm`).

To edit your code, any text editor can be used. VS Code and Atom have plugins for syntax highlight.

== Eclipse Plugin

NOTE: this plugin is a bit outdated and not maintained anymore. But Eclipse can still be used to edit the Java part of a JaCaMo project (e.g., artifacts). If you have a JaCaMo project with a `build.gradle` file, it is simple to *import gradle project* in Eclipse.

Requirements:

- Java >= 15
- Eclipse Java-EE or Committers >= Photon Release (4.8.0)

To get started, follow the http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/eclipseplugin/tutorial/[JaCaMo eclipse plugin] instructions until step 12. The steps 13 to 17 illustrate how to create and run a new application.

To include existing projects in your eclipse workspace, preferably use the option "file/import/import gradle project".

== Shell commands scripts

Requirements:

- Java >= 15

To use scripts to create and run JaCaMo applications, you can either
download JaCaMo from https://sourceforge.net/projects/jacamo/files[here]
or https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo[clone] from GitHub.
To configure these scripts:

. Make sure you have `JACAMO_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a directory with  subdirectories `libs` and `scripts` of JaCaMo), then setup the `PATH`.
In the case you have downloaded and unzipped JaCaMo into a local folder, say `/home/bob/jacamo`, the configuration is done by the following commands:

    export JACAMO_HOME=/home/bob/jacamo
    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

in the case you opted to clone JaCaMo from GitHub:

    git clone https://github.com/jacamo-lang/jacamo.git
    cd jacamo
    ./gradlew config
    export JACAMO_HOME=`pwd`/build
    export PATH=$JACAMO_HOME/scripts:$PATH

. Ensure you have `JAVA_HOME` properly set (this variable points to a Java Development Kit (JDK) directory), for instance:

    export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-15.0.2.jdk/Contents/Home

Available scripts:

. *Create* a new application identified by `helloworld` with
+
----
jacamo-new-project ../somewhere/helloworld
----
Examples of agent, artifact and organization are placed in the `src` folder. If the application name is not informed, the user is asked to provide one. A second, optional, argument is `--console` and creates an application where the messages are printed in the console instead of opening the MAS Console GUI.


. *Compile* and *run* an application with
+
    jacamo ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm

. *Run* an application with
+
    jacamo-run ../somewhere/helloworld/helloworld.jcm


. To create a single jar file with all resources to run the application:
+
----
jacamo-jar helloworld.jcm
----
that can be run by
+
----
java -jar helloworld.jar
----

== Docker

Requirements:

- https://www.docker.com/[Docker]

See link:https://github.com/jacamo-lang/docker[JaCaMo-Docker page] for instructions on how to create and run JaCaMo application using Docker images.

== Atom

For an IDE lighter than Eclipse, we recommend https://atom.io[Atom]. The following packages provide syntax highlight for AgentSpeak (the Jason language) and JCM projects: https://atom.io/packages/language-jcm[language-jcm] and https://atom.io/packages/language-agentspeak[language-agentspeak].
